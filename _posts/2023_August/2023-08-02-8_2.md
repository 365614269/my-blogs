### Morning
 - Kept updating docs...

### Afternoon
 - Updated half of the CNCF Sandbox projects to the knowledgebase.
 - Tried to resolve the previous envoy document issue.
 - Found that I need to actually build the documentation site using Docker...
 - Classic issue: I need to reinstall the Windows Subsystem Linux to get Docker working.
 - I couldn't enter a username for linux. Resolved by adding the following to the regedit:
 - >Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
   >
   >[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WinSock2\Parameters\AppId_Catalog\0408F7A3]
   >"AppFullPath"="C:\\Windows\\System32\\wsl.exe"
   >"PermittedLspCategories"=dword:80000000
 - Finally, it turned out the documentation site is not supported on windows...
