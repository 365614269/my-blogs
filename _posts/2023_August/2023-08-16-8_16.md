### Morning
 - Kept working on the gitlab workflow.
 - Command to switch branch:
 > `git checkout branch_name`
 - Read the linux book.
 - Learned how to prevent bugs in shell scripts.
 - e.g. if a file is named "-rf /", running "rm *" can result in "rm -rf /"!
 - The safer way is "rm ./*".

### Afternoon
 - Finally worked out:
 - The workflow requires an "Access Token" so that it has the priviledge to push.
 - Wrote an internship proof for later use.
