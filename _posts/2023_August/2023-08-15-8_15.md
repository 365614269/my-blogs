### Morning
 - Found that the previous new idea didn't work.
 - Because fastgpt.daocloud.io couldn't be accessed on github.
 
### Afternoon
 - Tried to do the same thing on gitlab, but turned out unsuccessful.
 - Because there is not environment to run the workflow...
 - Read the linux book.
 - Learned how to receive keyboard input (read), if statements and while loop.
 - :syntax on enables syntax highlighting in vim.
