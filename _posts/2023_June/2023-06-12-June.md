 - Installed DCE 5.0 on a Virtual Machine. A pod called "local-path-storage" kept failing.
 - It was because there was a taint on the pod.
 - Later began working on the Morning Event Master (MEM). 
 - After a few days, it failed because the audio to text accuracy rate was to low.
 - Take note that use the command "pip install pyyaml" when downloading the yaml library.
 - Use "import yaml" when importing the package in the code.
 - Discovered when signing up for ChatGPT:
   -> For temporary email address: https://temp-mail.org
   -> For temporary phone number: https://sms-activate.org
 - For the phone number, directly purchase a physical American phone number, this will 100% work.
 - Use Ubuntu Recovery mode to enter the root account when accidentally changed a Ubuntu system configuration file.
