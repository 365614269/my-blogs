### Morning
 - Still struggled on the main function...

### Afternoon
 - Learned zip command in Linux.
 - Asked the best Front-End Developer to resolve the main function's problem. He made use of "useState" in React.
 - Successfully uploaded the widget on APITable, though encountered some issues on running the command "widget-cli release".
 - Actually we just need to run "widget-cli release --uploadHost https://apitable.daocloud.io"
