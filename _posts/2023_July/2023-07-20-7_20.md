### Morning
 - Set up the github blog server.
 - Changed the widget a little so that it returns the data in multile fields rather than just one long string.
 
### Afternoon
 - Learned gzip, bzip2, tar commands in Linux
 - Created a new widget so that it detects the content of the currently highlighted cell.
 - Still trying to request the FastGPT API.
