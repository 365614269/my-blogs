### Morning
 - Read The Linux Command Line，Learned to use "ps" and "kill" command to manage the processes of Linux.
 
### Afternoon
 - Working on building an n8n community node again. Encountered node and npm compability issues. Finally Tackled through uninstalling node，and used nvm to install node v16. The previous version was node v20. For node v20, nvm didn't install the corresponding npm of correct version.
 - After resolving the compatibility issue, building the code remained unsuccessful. The "npm run build" command consistently failed.
