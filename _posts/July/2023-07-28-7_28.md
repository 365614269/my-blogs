### Morning
 - Uploaded all the CNCF graduated projects docs to the knowledgebase.
 
### Afternoon
 - Learned how to download only part of a remote repository:
   - mkdir repo
   - git clone -n --depth=1 --filter=tree:0 https://github.com/repo/repo.git
   - cd repo
   - git sparse-checkout set --no-cone folder1 folder2
   - git checkout
 - The above script downloads only folder1 and folder2 from repo.
 - Uploaded half of the CNCF incubating projects to the knowledgebase
 - The C:\\Users\\username\\.bash_history file stores all the git bash historical commands.
