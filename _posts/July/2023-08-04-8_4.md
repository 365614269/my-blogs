### Morning
 - Kept updating docs...
 - Tried to use GPT-4 to refine the morning event speech recognition text, but unsuccessful.

### Afternoon
 - Successfully tried GPT-4, the quality of text refinement is much better.
 - Turned out the result is much better than ChatGPT(GPT-3.5)
 - I wanted to install moviepy, because I want to reduce the mp4 morning events video to mp3.
 - It was installed in Python 3.11, but my PyCharm uses Python 3.12.
 - Originally, I wanted to try pyenv to switch versions of python.
 - Unsuccessful since I couldn't configure the environment variables...
 - Finally successful by directly installing the library in Python 3.12's site-packages using the command:
 - >pip install moviepy --target "D:\Program Files\Python312\Lib\site-packages"
