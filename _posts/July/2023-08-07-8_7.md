 - In other words, the clone was not complete.
 - Solved by initializing LFS of git:
 > git lfs install
 - Downloading large files always need patience...
 - Encountered another error:

 - Workaround: if I run the model with CPU, it goes fine, but it's too slow.
 - Real Solution: Reinstalling PyTorch with CUDA Support
 - Resolved by going to the PyTorch official website, pytorch.org, and ran the following command;
 > pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117

 - Lesson learned: pull the
