### Morning
 - Read the linux book, learned how to mount a file system and network related knowledge.

### Afternoon
 - Continued reading the linux book, learned how to use locate and find.
 - Kept working on the APITable Widget, today a new function was added.
 - Except for directly letting the user to input the query, it's also available on a dropdown box.
 - Originally the plan was to read the cell content when it was clicked.
 - But it turned out that apitable didn't have the event to return the content of a clicked cell.
